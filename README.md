This introduction to JSON requires basic knowledge of Python programming.
If you're unfamiliar with programming, we recommend that you first work through our 
[Python introduction](https://scriptotek.github.io/programming-for-lawyers/).

We recommend using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html)
at the University of Oslo [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.uio.no/).
If you don't have access to JupyterHub, you can use Google's
[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/scriptotek/programming-for-lawyers/).
